Salesforce Lightning Web Component Cookbook, Published by Packt

This is the code repository for Salesforce Lightning Web Component Cookbook, Published by Packt.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders by chapter under the `force-app` folder. Each chapter folder contains the relevant sub folders for deployment of a project into a Salesforce org, such as `classes` and `lwc`. In order to deploy to your Salesforce org, you must have the Salesforce Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code installed, as well as the Salesforce CLI.

To access the code in the repository, fork the repository and clone your fork into your local VSCode. From there, authorize a free Salesforce Developer Org (sign up [HERE](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup)), and deploy the `force-app` folder.

## Description
Salesforce developers strive to build fast, scalable, and efficient apps—whether to streamline business processes, enhance user experience, or modernize legacy systems. But mastering Lightning Web Components (LWC) can be complex. Salesforce Lightning Web Development Cookbook simplifies this journey with 70-plus recipes that guide you through every stage of LWC development with step-by-step solutions to real-world challenges faced by Salesforce developers. This book covers key concepts such as component composition, data retrieval, event handling, and performance optimization. You'll explore advanced topics such as writing accessible components, migrating from Visualforce and Aura, and testing LWCs using Jest and Apex. Each recipe is carefully crafted to provide clear explanations, concise code snippets, and best practices to ensure you can immediately apply what you learn to your projects. By the end of the book, you’ll be able to successfully build and scale Lightning Web Components for enterprise-grade applications. Whether you're developing new features, troubleshooting performance issues, or transitioning legacy code, this book will equip you with the expertise needed to streamline development and create high-performance applications.

## Who Is This Book For?
This cookbook is for intermediate to experienced Salesforce developers looking to master advanced Lightning Web Components (LWC) techniques. It provides practical solutions for optimizing performance, implementing complex UI patterns, and integrating LWC within the Salesforce ecosystem.
