## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders by chapter under the `force-app` folder. Each chapter folder contains the relevant sub folders for deployment of a project into a Salesforce org, such as `classes` and `lwc`. In order to deploy to your Salesforce org, you must have the Salesforce Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code installed, as well as the Salesforce CLI.

To access the code in the repository, fork the repository and clone your fork into your local VSCode. From there, authorize a free Salesforce Developer Org (sign up [HERE](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup)), and deploy the `force-app` folder.
